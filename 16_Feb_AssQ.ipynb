    "- SQL : \n",
    "1. SQL databases are relational.\n",
    "2. SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) and have a predefined schema.  \n",
    "3. SQL databases are vertically scalable. \n",
    "\n",
    "- NoSQL : \n",
    "1. NoSQL databases are non-relational.\n",
    "2. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.\n",
