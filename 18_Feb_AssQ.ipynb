    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -\n",
    "\n",
    "- API stands for Application Programming Interface.\n",
    "- It is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.\n",
    "- Example: A weather app uses a weather data API to get the latest weather information and display it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -\n",
    "- **Advantages of APIs :** Integration, efficiency, ecosystem growth, scalability, innovation, customization.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages of APIs :** Security risks, dependency, maintenance overhead, cost, complexity, data privacy concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web API :** A Web API isÂ an application programming interface (API) for the Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differentiate between API and Web API :**\n",
    "- An API is like a bridge that lets different software talk to each other.\n",
    "- A Web API is a specific type of bridge that works over the internet using web technology.\n",
    "- It's a way for apps to ask a server for data or services, like asking for weather information.\n",
    "- So, all Web APIs are APIs, but not all APIs are specifically for the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST (Representational State Transfer) :**\n",
    "- An architectural style for designing networked applications based on a stateless client-server model.\n",
    "- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication.\n",
    "- Lightweight, simple, and easy to implement.\n",
    "- Widely used in web services and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) :**\n",
    "- A protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services.\n",
    "- Uses XML as the message format and can run over various lower-level protocols.\n",
    "- Complex and difficult to pick up.\n",
    "- More rigid and heavyweight compared to REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shortcomings of SOAP :**\n",
    "- **Wordiness**: SOAP messages are typically larger due to XML formatting.\n",
    "- **Slower**: The parsing and processing of XML in SOAP can make it slower.\n",
    "- **Less Human-Readable**: SOAP messages are less human-readable compared to REST.\n",
    "- **Complex**: SOAP is complex and difficult to pick up, making it less straightforward to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST(Representational State Transfer) :**\n",
    "- Uses standard HTTP methods.\n",
    "- Lightweight, simple, and easy to implement.\n",
    "- Data can be in various formats like JSON, XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) :**\n",
    "- Uses XML-based messaging protocol.\n",
    "- Complex and difficult to pick up.\n",
    "- Can use various transport protocols, not limited to HTTP."
