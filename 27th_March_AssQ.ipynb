    "\n",
    "Ans -\n",

    "**R-Squared (R²):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- R-squared is a number that tells you how well the independent variables explain the dependent variable.\n",
    "- It shows how well the model's predictions match the actual data.\n",
    "- R-squared values range from 0 to 1, where 0 means no explanation of the variance, and 1 means full explanation of the variance.\n",
    "- An R-squared of 0.8 means that 80% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables.\n",
    "- Higher R-squared values indicate a better fit between the model and the data.\n",
    "- The formula for R-squared (R²) is : 1 - (Sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the predicted values / The sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the actual values)\n",
    "- In simple terms, a higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans - \n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjusted R-squared :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjusted R-squared modifies the R-squared value to account for the number of predictors in the model.\n",
    "- It adjusts for the fact that adding more predictors to a model will generally increase R-squared, even if those predictors are not actually improving the model.\n",
    "- The adjustment is made to penalize the addition of irrelevant predictors, which makes Adjusted R-squared a more accurate measure when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
    "- Adjusted R-squared helps in selecting the best model by considering the number of predictors, avoiding overfitting (where the model fits the training data very well but performs poorly on new data).\n",
    "- Adjusted R-squared adjusts the regular R-squared by accounting for the number of predictors in the model. \n",
    "- It penalizes for adding unnecessary predictors that do not significantly improve model fit, providing a more realistic assessment of how well the model explains the variance in the dependent variable. \n",
    "- A higher adjusted R-squared indicates a better balance between model simplicity and explanatory power.\n",
    "- **Value**:\n",
    "    - It can be lower than R-squared but it provides a more accurate measure of model performance.\n",
    "    - If adding a predictor improves the model, Adjusted R-squared will increase; if not, it will decrease.\n",

    "- Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate when comparing models with different numbers of features. \n",
    "- It adjusts for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate measure of model fit by penalizing the addition of unnecessary features. \n",
    "- Unlike regular R-squared, which always increases with more features, adjusted R-squared increases only if the new feature improves the model more than would be expected by chance. \n",

    "1. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: \n",
    "    1. The average of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values.\n",
    "    2. High MSE means there are large errors between predictions and actual values. \n",
    "    3. It tells us how spread out the errors are.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: \n",
    "    1. The average of the absolute differences between the actual and predicted values.\n",
    "    2. High MAE indicates a large average error. \n",
    "    3. It shows the average magnitude of the errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: \n",
    "    1. The square root of the average of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values.\n",
    "    2. High RMSE suggests significant errors, similar to MSE, but in the same units as the data. \n",
    "    3. It gives an overall idea of error magnitude.\n",

    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "    - Provides a clear interpretation as it is in the same unit as the target variable.\n",

    "Q6. Explain the concept of Lasso regularization. How does it differ from Ridge regularization, and when is\n",
    "it more appropriate to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso regression :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that helps you make more accurate predictions and understand which factors are most important.\n",
    "- It's like regular linear regression but with a twist to avoid overcomplicating the model.\n",
    "- Lasso regression helps you build a simple, accurate, and easy-to-understand model by focusing on the most important factors and ignoring the less important ones.\n",
    "- It avoids overcomplication and helps in making better predictions with new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is This Useful ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoids Overfitting**: Overfitting happens when your model works great on the data you have but poorly on new data. Lasso helps prevent this by keeping only the important factors.\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**: By shrinking some coefficients to zero, Lasso automatically selects the most important factors for you.\n",
    "3. **Simpler Model**: With fewer important factors, your model becomes simpler and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example :**\n",
    "Let's say you have a dataset to predict house prices with 10 factors (size, rooms, age, etc.). Regular linear regression might use all 10 factors, even if some are not very important. Lasso regression might find that only 3 out of these 10 factors are really important and set the coefficients for the other 7 factors to zero. This way, your prediction model focuses only on the key factors, making it simpler and more robust.\n",

    "Q7. How do regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning? Provide an example to illustrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularized linear models :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularized linear models like Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net Regression prevent overfitting by adding penalties to the loss function based on model complexity.\n",
    "- Ridge Regression penalizes the sum of squared coefficients, encouraging smaller coefficients and reducing model complexity.\n",
    "- Lasso Regression penalizes the sum of absolute coefficients, promoting sparsity by forcing some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "- Elastic Net Regression combines both Ridge and Lasso penalties, offering a compromise that handles multicollinearity and selects important features.\n",
    "- These penalties prevent models from fitting noise in the data, improving generalization to new data.\n",
    "- Ridge Regression helps manage multicollinearity by shrinking correlated coefficients.\n",
    "- While, Lasso Regression selects the most relevant features and disregards others.\n",
    "- Elastic Net Regression provides a balanced approach, useful when some features are correlated and feature selection is needed.\n",
    "- For example, when predicting house prices from various features,\n",
    "    - Ridge Regression would penalize less influential features to prevent them from impacting predictions too much.\n",
    "    - Lasso Regression might eliminate noise features by setting their coefficients to zero, simplifying the model.\n",
    "    - Elastic Net Regression would handle both scenarios by managing correlated features and performing feature selection simultaneously.\n",
    "- These methods are crucial in datasets with many features, enhancing model simplicity and performance by focusing on essential features while reducing overfitting and improving robustness.\n",

    "Q8. Discuss the limitations of regularized linear models and explain why they may not always be the best\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans -\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of Regularized Linear Models in Regression Analysis :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularized linear models like Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net have some drawbacks.\n",
    "- They assume that the relationship between features and the target is linear, which isn't always the case, leading to poor performance with nonlinear data.\n",
    "- Lasso can remove useful features, and regularization can make the model's results harder to understand.\n",
    "- These models need careful feature scaling before use.\n",
    "- Over-regularization can make the model too simple, causing poor predictions.\n",
    "- Also, choosing the right amount of regularization requires extra tuning and computation.\n",
    "- These factors can make regularized linear models less suitable in some situations.\n",

    "Q9. You are comparing the performance of two regression models using different evaluation metrics. Model A has an RMSE of 10, while Model B has an MAE of 8. Which model would you choose as the better performer, and why? Are there any limitations to your choice of metric?\n",
    "\n",

    "**Choosing the Better Performing Model Based on RMSE and MAE :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model A has an RMSE of 10.\n",
    "- Model B has an MAE of 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model B** would generally be considered the better performer because an MAE of 8 indicates smaller average errors compared to Model A's RMSE of 10. RMSE tends to be higher than MAE for the same model because it penalizes larger errors more, meaning Model A likely has larger errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are limitations to these metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RMSE** is more sensitive to outliers and larger errors, so it can give a sense of how severe the worst errors are.\n",
    "- **MAE** treats all errors equally, providing a straightforward average error, but it doesn’t highlight large errors as much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while Model B appears better based on MAE, consider the context of your problem. If large errors are particularly important, RMSE might be more relevant. Each metric has its strengths, and the best choice can depend on your specific needs.\n",

Model A uses Ridge regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.1, while Model B uses Lasso regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.5.

    "   - Keeps all features but shrinks their coefficients.\n",
    "   - Good when you believe all features are important.\n",
    "   - Less likely to remove features, so it may be better if you don't want to lose any potentially useful information.\n",

    "   - Can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively removing features.\n",
    "   - Useful for feature selection when you think many features are irrelevant.\n",
    "   - Higher regularization parameter (0.5) means more aggressive feature removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs and Limitations**:\n",
    "- **Ridge (Model A)**: May keep irrelevant features, possibly leading to a more complex model.\n",
    "- **Lasso (Model B)**: Can remove important features, especially with a high regularization parameter, but results in a simpler model.\n",

    "**Conclusion**:\n",
